## Requirements

Create a basic REST API that runs as a docker container and does the following:

    * Has a resource that is a user
    * User should have an attribute that describes its relationship to other uses (think friends)
    * Seeds user data (static list or DB whichever is preferred)
    * Serves CRUD endpoints for the user resource
    * Has an additional endpoint that finds the relationship distance from one user to another user (this user is a 2nd, 3rd, distance relationship)
